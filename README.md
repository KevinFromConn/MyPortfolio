# MyPortfolio

This portfolio shows off all of my accomplishments thusfar as a web developer. As my skills improve and my worklog increases, I will continue to update and enhance both the content of the page, as well as the aesthetics of the page. This portfolio contains links to my completed works, as well as a link to my resume.
