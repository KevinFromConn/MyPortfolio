# MyPortfolio

This portfolio, though a work-in-progress, shows off all of my accomplishments thusfar in this bootcamp. As my skills improve and my worklog increases, I will continue to update and enhance both the content of the page, as well as the aesthetics of the page. I have links to my completed works, as well as placeholders for any future work I will complete.
